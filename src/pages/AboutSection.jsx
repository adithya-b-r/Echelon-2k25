          Every edition of Echelon celebrates a new dimension of management.
          This year, we explore the rapidly evolving concept of Quick Commerce,
          a phenomenon that is redefining the global business landscape. As
          technology accelerates and customer expectations evolve, the future
          belongs to those who can speed, spark, and surge — faster than ever
          before. In an age where time is the new currency, this model has
          transformed logistics, marketing, finance, and human resource
          strategies — making "speed with precision" the new mantra of success.
